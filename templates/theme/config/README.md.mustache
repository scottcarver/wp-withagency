## Build Scripts

To work on the site run this command to install the npm dependencies:
``npm install``

To work on the site with a local server, livereload and file watching:
``gulp watch``

**Additional Scripts:**
Create /dist/ without a server:
``gulp build``

you can to do the same with:
``gulp`` 

**NPM Bindings:**
Additionally there are NPM scripts available bound to the above tasks at:

``npm run gulp`` and ``npm run watch``

**Clean Task:**
It is sometimes useful to **delete the generated files.** You can do this with ``gulp clean`` ('style.css' file and '/dist/' directory will be deleted). Regenrate all the files again by running `gulp build`

## External Builds
The **/dist/** directory is critical for theme operation, yet is **not included in version control** - if the site is synched with a devops style deploy script it will be critical to run `gulp` and generate the dist file programatically.




# Working on the gulpfile
The build scripts can be edited at ``gulpfile.js/index.js`` and surrounding files (javsascript_combined.json and javascript_copied.json)

Each function is annotated but they can be refined as needed. Note how the functions ``watch`` and ``buid`` are defined and relate to the notes above!
