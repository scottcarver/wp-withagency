#### Running Subcommands
Typing `wp withagency SUBCOMMAND --prompt` into the terminal (with a subcommand listed above)


## Understanding WP CLI Constants
When creating themes it is necessary to reuse certain text-strings, such as the "text domain" for internationalization. For theming purposes, we use client-namespaced BEM  - and this "client namespace" is another repetitive text string. 



## ü¶Ñ Goals
- be able to write and edit generators to match our needs
- identify functions, templates, patterns, etc that will be the basis of our generators
- maintain the generator over time as an alternative to a "starter theme." Though we will be able to generate themes, it will be done through through composition, not subtraction, as has been the case with cleaning up megathemes to suit our needs.

## üìù Editing the Docs
Follow the README.md instructions inside of the /docs/ folder, which is a standalone Eleventy Project

## üìù Generator Notes
Currently You can Generate a Theme
wp withagency theme

Here is an example that will gernate a theme
```wp withagency theme --name=banjo --slug=beej  --domain=banjo-domain --prefix=bj```

OR
```wp withagency theme --prompt```
