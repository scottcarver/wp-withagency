`wp withagency` is a command line *tool for creating themes* in WordPress. It's very similar to the "wp cli scaffold" command but seperates features with *more granularity*. Read more on how to get [Getting Setup](/setup/), and and begin using [Commands](/commands/).  Additionally, because WP sites are complex creatures, there is a summarized overview of issues in the [Reference](/reference/) section. This is not an official tool but does attempt to follow best-practices. After getting through the basics, the notes on [Advanced Usage](/usage/) will be more useful.

## Why does this Exist?
One of the most common questions in WordPressLand is "What Theme Should I Use"? My [personal](https://scottcarver.info) answer has always been *"the one you built from scratch"* and this tool helps aid that process by breaking breaking it into smaller steps instead of one big one. You can follow along with the [Github Repo](https://github.com/scottcarver/wp-withagency) here, which *contains both the plugin and the docs*.
