"**wp withagency**" is a command line tool for creating themes in WordPress. It's very similar to the 'wp cli scaffold' command but with a few new features to granularly build out features.

## Commands
- Block

###
<!-- 
set of best practices, recommendations and code standards for creating and maintaining WordPress sites. It's opinionated but always makes an attempt to unravel complexity, and do things the WordPress way when possible. In publishing these coding standards in a public location I'm able to better refine my process. I'm hoping to achieve greater consistency and allow my collaborators to start making meaningful contributions quickly.

### Bonus
- Discussion of common scenarios and [Recommended Solutions](/solutions)
- Timeline of Pollinate WP projects


- **Timeline** of Agency Projects  -->

<!-- 
### Problems this Addresses
- What should I use as a starter theme? 
- What plugins should I use? 
- How do I name things? 
- How do I create posttypes, taxonomies, feeds, pages, components?
- How do I manage things in version control?
- How do I deploy sites?
- How do I deploy to a Static Server?

### Use Cases
- A Developer makes iterative improvements to an existing project
- A Developer sets up a new project and theme from scratch
- A Developer takes over and makes changes during *temporarily* vacation, illness, or *permanently* due to changing ownership, etc
- A potential hire views this documentation prior to interview, so we can evaulate them based on what we need them to know
- A Pollinate developer who presents about WordPress might rely on this as a reference to our practices
- Project Manager points 3rd party to our docs to clarify requirements
- A random internet person is critical of our approach and we use that as a learning moment

### Disclaimers
- This document is intentionally made public yet these guidelines are intended for the Pollinate Agency team's internal use, which is small.
- our approach encourages creating projects with room for variation. This is not an attempt to create a "standard design libary" for the agency.
- we're not focused on "Design systems as a deliverable." Our focus is on "website as a deliverable" while following similar principles of component-based design.
- our techniques evolve. This is just what we were doing at a snapshot in time.

We hope the approaches and patterns are generally useful. Feel free to [email](mailto:scott.carver@pollinate.com) if you have any feedback.
