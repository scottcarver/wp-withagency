"**wp withagency**" is a command line tool for creating themes in WordPress. It's very similar to the "**wp cli scaffold**" command but seperates features with *more granularity*. Read more on how to get [Setup](/setup/), and and begin using [Commands](/commands/). After getting through the basics, the notes on [Advanced Usage](/usage/) will be more useful. Additionally, because WP sites are complex creatures, there is a summarized overview of issues in the [Reference](/reference/) section. This is not an official tool but does attempt to follow best-practices.
