### üìà Improvements

1. Currently the write-paths to the JS and SCSS file are specific to the theme structure from the "theme" command. Particularly this consists of <code class="language-bash">/gulpfile.js/javascript_copied.json</code>, <code class="language-bash">/gulpfile.js/javascript_inactive.json</code>, <code class="language-bash">/library/style/custom/_custom_components.scss</code> - until this is seperated as it's own constant it's recommended to not run the "activate" flag. The files will be added to your theme and you can "wire them up" based on your needs.
2. When making updates to the scss, it would be nice to include <code class="language-css">// Component Name</code> on the line prior to the include
