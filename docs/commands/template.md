You can quickly generate a "post, page" template using this command. You can refine to include other *Post Types* **once the file is generated**.

***

### 🎉 Basic Usage

Type this into your terminal to prompt for inputs:
```
wp withagency template --prompt
```

If you run this code, the plugin will prompt for inputs

***

### 📌 Required Values
- **slug** - this will be used in the filename that is created - *This should be lowercase and no special characters except dashes (-)*
- **name** - this will be the Name of The Template which will appear in the WP admin selection screen.  *This can include upper/lowercase letters and spaces*


***

### ⚙️ Advanced Usage
If you know the values you want to use beforehand, you can pass the parameters into the command all at once and *Create a New Theme with a Single Line*:

```
wp withagency theme --slug=homepage --name=Homepage
```

**Typing this into the terminal would:**
1. create a new file in an existing folder "templates/page-home.php" 
2. That file would include reference to the "name"
