You can **quickly generate arbitary routes** using this command. A "route" is slightly different than a page template in that it captures input though the url *dynamically* and allows you to program around that. *This is unlike the built-in WP-JSON API in that you have full control over the file type, and url.* This is very powerful and works in a similar way to route handing in traditional MVCs. Doing this requires the <code class="language-bash">CustomRoutes</code> class to be defined. It's not included in the theme by default although that's possible, and easy. Currently it's seperated into a plugin, [WP Enrouter](https://github.com/scottcarver/wp-enrouter) and when it's installed/active routes will work. The [WP Inquirist](https://github.com/scottcarver/wp-inquirist) will prompt you to install WP Enrouter when used as directed.

#### Examples:

- PHP: **/coords/{lat}/{long}/** - capture lat/long dynamically and show an HTML/PHP page using the command `wp withagency route --slug=coords --format=php`
- JSON: **/startdate/enddate/changelog.json** - an arbitrary url which outputs json using the command `wp withagency route --slug=changelog --format=json`
- XML: **/year-month-somedata.xml/** - structured data as xml using the command `wp withagency route --slug=somedata --format=xml`

Note that these examples each use 2 wildcards (lat/lng, startdate/enddate, year/month), which is accurate to the generated files. You can alter the code however to have any number of capture groups, or none, which gives you full-control over your url structure.

### üéâ Basic Usage

Type this into your terminal to prompt for inputs:
<pre><code class="language-bash">wp withagency route --prompt</code></pre>

If you run this code, the plugin will prompt for inputs

***

### üìå Required Values
- **slug** - used in *the filename* that is created. Uses [is_slugworthy](/reference/class/#slug)
- **format** - used to select a starter template. Valid inputs are ("xml","json", "php")

### üÜò Help Command

Type this into your terminal for detailed help:

<pre><code class="language-bash">wp help withagency route</code></pre>


***

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage
If you know the values you want to use beforehand, you can pass the parameters into the command all at once and *Create a New Template with a Single Line*:

<pre><code class="language-bash">wp withagency route --slug=special --format=xml</code></pre>

**Typing this into the terminal would:**
1. create a new file in <code class="language-bash">DEST_ROUTE_FOLDER/route_{slug}.php</code>
2. create a new file in <code class="language-bash">DEST_ROUTE_FOLDER/route_{slug}_template.php</code>
3. update the file <code class="language-bash">function/custom/custom_routes.php</code> to require the files

***

### üìà Improvements

1. Include --activate flag, whether the file is included immediately
2. Update help for the route command to reference DEST_ROUTE_FOLDER (currently it's hardcoded in the help as <code class="language-bash">/routes/routename.php</code>)
