## Software

You are welcome to manage your git activity in a terminal environment or a graphical user interface. It doesn't matter as long as you follow the general guidelines. Examples of graphical git clients currently in use by the team include [Git Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) and [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). This is an example of software that is directly related to work that makes you more productive so purchasing it is easliy justified. Reach out to your manager and they'll get you a license.

## Git Flow
In the past git itself has been a source of problems so we're moving towards a standardized approach based on the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) methodology. This diagram shows that:

### Production
Formerly (Master) is the main branch and is used for deploying code to the live/production site. No work is ever done directly to this branch.

### Develop
This is a clone of Production, and where changes get integrated. This allows us to test new integrations without messing with Production. Once everything is looking good, it can be written to Production.

### Features
Feature branches are added whenever a developer needs to do work in isolation without the risk of it getting pushed. This is done by branching Develop, making changes, then merging them back into Develop

### Hotfixes 
Sometimes things come up that need changed fast. In this case it's acceptable to create a branch off of Production, create a Feature branch and make fixes. The trick here is that once you're done it needs to be merged into *both Production and Develop*. Otherwise the next time Develop is merged into Production, there is a likelyhood/risk the hotfix will be blown away.


## Deployments

We follow a 3-site model of localhost/staging/live for our WordPress sites. Typical changes would be 


- production
- development

2 branches on git -- initialized on the theme level

master -> production
staging -> Staging
dev -> Development

dev was for the new changes and the client never sees the dev site. After the project manager approves we merge changes to staging. Database can be filled with test posts and plugins. Good for debugging anything strange that can happen beyond the local environment.

Staging is to test the git merger from dev to staging. This is an exact database copy of Prod and the clients can see at all times. Important to keep the database updated to match what will be seen on production. All plugins match prod exactly.

Then when the client approves you can merge to master and deploy to production.
I would use ssh to pull each branch into each environment. If there is a good gitignore file then you can just ssh and git pull from each environment to deploy. I would keep a list of commands for the file directory of each environment. I would use terminal to ssh into the host then copy and paste the file directory and git pull.  It sounds like a lot but it is actually really fast.
Not saying this should be our process but just wanted to share mine.

## How to manage features launches
Sometimes a feature might be in develpment for awhile, and a hotfix is needed. 

## Common commands 

For more information this documentation from Atlassian on [Basic Git commands](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html)

Get the latest updates before beginning
```bash
git pull
```

Check for changes
```bash
git status
```

| baseDir    | -       | No       | If your Gatsby site does not live in the root of your project directory/git repo, pass the subdirectory name here (ex: `docs`) |

## Example usage

```php title=gatsby-config.php
â€‹<?php
// 1) Defines a route at YOURWPSITE.com/wp-json/locations/list
add_action( 'rest_api_init', function () {
    register_rest_route( 'locations', 'list', array(
      'methods' => 'GET',
      'callback' => 'get_clean_location_data_as_json',
    ) );
});
â€‹
// 2) the callback function creates a feed of individual entries
function get_clean_location_data_as_json() {
  // Do a WP Query
  $query = new WP_Query(array('post_type'=>'post'));
  // Isolate entries
  $locations = $query->posts;
  // Empty storage for entries
  $entries = array();
  // Just give up now, if empty
  if ( empty( $locations ) ) {return null;}
  // Loop over Entries
  foreach($locations as $location){
    // Storing each entry in a our array
    array_push($entries, singleLocationEntry($location));
  }
  // Return array as JSON
  return $entries;
}
â€‹
// 3) This function creates data representing a single entry
function singleLocationEntry($location){
    // Get ID
    $entryID = $location->ID;
    // Use Available Keys like this
    $entryTitle = $location->post_title ?: 'fallback';
    // Use the ID to get metadata
    $entryField = get_the_title($entryID) . '+1' ?: 'fallback';
    // Build a simplified entry with only the data you need
    $entry = array(
        'ID'=>$entryID,
        'title'=>$entryTitle,
        'field'=>$entryField,
    );
    // Return an array for this single entry
    return $entry;
}
?>
```

Once you have installed the dependencies you will need to create the [navigation](/usage/navigation) and [documentation](/usage/creating-docs) file.

After that, you are ready ðŸš€
