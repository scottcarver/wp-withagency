In addition to the plugins we use, these businesses and services are part of our WordPress Practice.


## WP Engine
Almost all of our sites are hosted on WP engine, either through our Agency account, or through client accounts, which we encourage. In this scenario the client will add our developers through the WP Engine interface.


## Sendgrid
Most email, even on WordPress sites is sent through SendGrid.
