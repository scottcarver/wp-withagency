In addition to the plugins we use, these businesses and services are part of our WordPress Practice.


## WP Engine
Almost all of our sites are hosted on WP engine, either through our Agency account, or through client accounts, which we encourage. In this scenario the client will add our developers through the WP Engine interface.

## Atlassian

## Jira and Basecamp
The agency uses Jira for project management because it's close integration with bitbucket ticketing. Certain clients will use basecamp instead of Jira. Your Project Manager will be able to point you to your work, if it's not clear, and it might not be.

## Wiki
Pollinate maintains a wiki of internal information. You know where it is. And it's smart to know what goes there, versus here, the WP Pollinate docs. Anything client-specific, and particularly any protected passwords, usernames, etc should not be made public - it goes in the wiki. Anything related to process, tools, solutions, which is nonproprietary goes here.


## Sendgrid
Most email, even on WordPress sites is sent through SendGrid.
